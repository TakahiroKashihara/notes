Here, by investigating the Dirac model of even-dimensional Chern insulator, we give the general relation between Berry curvature and quantum metric, which indicates that the Chern number can be encoded in quantum metric as well as the surface area of the Brillouin zone on the hypersphere embedded in Euclidean parameter space. We find that there is a corresponding relationship between the quantum metric and the metric on such a hypersphere. We give the geometrical property of quantum metric. Besides, we give a protocol to measure the quantum metric in the degenerate system.}

abstract = {The discovery of the quantum spin Hall effect and topological insulators more than a decade ago has revolutionized modern condensed matter physics. Today, the field of topological states of matter is one of the most active and fruitful research areas for both experimentalists and theorists. The physics of topological insulators is typically well described by band theory and systems of non-interacting fermions. In contrast, several of the most fascinating effects in condensed matter physics merely exist due to electron?electron interactions, examples include unconventional superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and the Mott?Hubbard transition.

The aim of this review article is to give an overview of the manifold directions which emerge when topological bandstructures and correlation physics interfere and compete. These include the study of the stability of topological bandstructures and correlated topological insulators. Interaction-induced topological phases such as the topological Kondo insulator provide another exciting topic. More exotic states of matter such as topological Mott insulator and fractional Chern insulators only exist due to the interplay of topology and strong interactions and do not have any bandstructure analogue. Eventually the relation between topological bandstructures and frustrated quantum magnetism in certain transition metal oxides is emphasized.}

abstract={In 1964 Kohn published the milestone paper ``Theory of the insulating state'', accordingto which insulators and metals differ in their ground state. Even before the system is excitedby any probe, a different organization of the electrons is present in the ground state and this isthe key feature discriminating between insulators and metals. However,the theory of the insulating state remained somewhat incomplete until the late 1990s; this review addresses the recentdevelopments. The many-body ground wavefunction of any insulator is characterized by means ofgeometrical concepts (Berry phase, connection, curvature, Chern number, quantum metric). Amongthem, it is the quantum metric which sharply characterizes the insulating state of matter. Thetheory deals on a common ground with several kinds of insulators: band insulators, Mott insulators,Anderson insulators, quantum Hall insulators, Chern and topological insulators.},

A phase of wavefunctions cannot be determined in a unique and smooth way over the entire magnetic Brillouin zone unless the magnetic subband carries no Hall current.}
